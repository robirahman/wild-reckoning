# Wild Reckoning

A high-fidelity wildlife survival simulator. Navigate the complex struggle for genetic fitness as one of 10 unique species across diverse biomes — from the Arctic Circle to the East African Savanna.

Navigate predators, parasites, weather, and ecosystem shifts in a turn-based, narrative-driven experience.

## Key Features

- **10 Playable Species:** Including White-Tailed Deer, African Elephant, Polar Bear, Monarch Butterfly, Honeybee, and more.
- **Deep Biological Simulation:** Multi-stage parasites, injury healing, seasonal thermoregulation, and nutrition systems.
- **Evolution & Lineage:** Accumulate genetic mutations and pass trait biases down to future generations.
- **Map Navigation:** Explore regional maps with dynamic resources and hazards.
- **Ecosystem Web:** Experience trophic cascades where your actions and environmental shifts impact predator-prey populations.

## Playable Species

| Species | Biome | Strategy |
|---------|-------|----------|
| White-Tailed Deer | Northern Forest | Iteroparous, prey avoidance |
| African Elephant | Savanna | Social hierarchy, long-term survival |
| Chinook Salmon | Ocean / River | Semelparous, epic migration |
| Green Sea Turtle | Caribbean Reef | Marine migration, nesting gauntlet |
| Polar Bear | Arctic Ice | Apex predator, climate resilience |
| Monarch Butterfly | North America | Multigenerational lineage, metamorphosis |
| Honeybee Worker | Temperate Meadow | Eusocial, hive survival |
| Common Octopus | Mediterranean | Intelligence, camouflage |
| Arctic Tern | Global | Pole-to-pole migration |
| Fig Wasp | Tropical Forest | Short-lived symbiosis |
