# Wild Reckoning — Future Feature Suggestions

This document tracks recommended features and content improvements for future development cycles.

---

## 1. Evolution & Progression

### Genetic "Trait Trees" (Evolution 2.0)
Instead of purely random mutations, implement a persistent **Mutation Tree**.
- **Requirement-Based Unlocks:** Surviving specific environmental threats (e.g., "Survived 3 Blizzards") unlocks a specific "branch" of mutations (e.g., "Insulated Fat Layer" -> "Metabolic Hibernation").
- **Meta-Progression:** Some traits could be unlocked globally across all playthroughs of a species.

## 2. Dynamic Environments

### Natural Disasters (Storyline Arcs)
Rare, high-impact events that temporarily or permanently alter the map:
- **Forest Fires:** Destroys "Forest" nodes in a region, forcing migration to "Plain" or "Water" nodes and triggering high `TRA` and `HOM` stress.
- **Oil Spills / Red Tides:** Marine-specific disasters for Turtles, Salmon, and Octopuses that drastically increase `IMM` load.
- **Human Encroachment:** A slow-burn storyline where "Forest" nodes are converted to "Suburban" nodes over 50+ turns, changing the predator and human encounter weights.

---

## 3. Social Complexity

### Advanced Social Structures
- **Elephant Matriarchy & Memory:** Older elephants (matriarchs) gain a "Memory" stat that provides a bonus to finding hidden water nodes during drought events.
- **Wolf Pack Management:** A dedicated UI panel to track the health and status of named pack members. Losing an "Alpha Mate" should trigger a massive `TRA` penalty but potentially allow the player to challenge for leadership.
- **Bee Colony Meta-Game:** The goal for the Honeybee could expand beyond individual survival to a "Colony Success" meter, culminating in a "Swarm" event to found a new hive.

---

## 4. Lineage & Persistence

### "Ghost of the Past" (Lineage 2.0)
In `LineageMode`, the player can encounter the physical legacy of previous generations:
- **Scent Markers:** "You find an old territorial marking. It smells of your sire." (+WIS boost).
- **Den Sites:** Re-using a previous generation's den provides a "Comfort" bonus, reducing `TRA` decay.

---

## 5. New Species Archetypes

### Apex & Specialized Niches
- **Great White Shark:** Focusing on energy conservation, long-distance scent tracking, and high-stakes "Ambush Strike" mechanics.
- **Red-Tailed Hawk:** A "Vertical Map" experience where the primary resources are "Thermal Updrafts" and "Vantage Points."
- **Naked Mole Rat:** A "Subterranean Map" focus where oxygen levels, colony digging, and "Queen Defense" are the primary survival drivers.
- **Corvid (Raven/Crow):** An intelligence-first species focusing on tool use, facial recognition of individual human NPCs, and complex social alliances.
